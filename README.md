## Introduction
Welcome to the Quiz Game! This is an interactive game where users are authenticated via OpenID Connect, presented with questions randomly selected from a MySQL database, and shown the answers after a timer counts down to zero. 

## Features
- User authentication using OpenID Connect.
- Random question selection from a MySQL database.
- Countdown timer for each question.
- Display correct answers after the timer expires.

## Installation
To get started with the Quiz Game, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/quiz-game.git
   cd quiz-game
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the MySQL database**:
   - Ensure you have MySQL installed and running.
   - Create a database for the quiz game.
   - Import the provided database schema (see [Database Schema](#database-schema)).

4. **Configure environment variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
   - Add the necessary environment variables (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

5. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
Once the application is running, users can:
- Sign in using their OpenID Connect credentials.
- Start the quiz to answer random questions.
- View the correct answers after the timer counts down to zero.

## Configuration
The application requires several environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```env
# Database configuration
DB_HOST=your-database-host
DB_USER=your-database-username
DB_PASSWORD=your-database-password
DB_NAME=your-database-name

# OpenID Connect configuration
OIDC_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
OIDC_ISSUER=https://your-issuer-url
OIDC_REDIRECT_URI=http://your-app-url/callback

# Other configurations
PORT=3000
SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret
```

## Database Schema
The MySQL database should contain the following tables:

### `questions` Table
| Column      | Type        | Description                  |
|-------------|-------------|------------------------------|
| `id`        | INT         | Primary key                  |
| `question`  | TEXT        | The question text            |
| `answer`    | TEXT        | The correct answer           |

Here is an example SQL script to create the `questions` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE `questions` (
  `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `question` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `answer` TEXT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
);
```

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Authentication**: OpenID Connect
- **ORM**: Sequelize (optional)
